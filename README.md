# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
A school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonestly; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth grade appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help.

Our objective is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High school with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, our next objective will be to reapt the school district analysis completed in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes impacted the overall analysis.

## Results
